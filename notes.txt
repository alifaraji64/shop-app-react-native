Clipping Behavior:
When you apply borderRadius to a component,
the content inside the component is clipped according
 to the rounded corners.
 However, if the content exceeds the boundaries
  (like child elements or text that overflows),
 it may still appear outside the rounded corners.

The overflow: 'hidden' style is used to ensure that
 any content that goes beyond the component's
  boundary is clipped (hidden) and not rendered
   outside the rounded corners.

The asChild prop tells the Link to render its
child as
the clickable element, inheriting the functionality
 (like navigation)
without altering its structure or styling.

Folders wrapped in () are used purely for grouping files
and do not appear in the resulting route paths.
The files inside the folder are treated as if
they were in the parent directory.

How Middleware Works
1-A request is sent to your server (e.g., a user accesses /dashboard).
2-The request hits the middleware.
3-Middleware performs its logic (e.g., token validation, redirects).
4-The middleware decides whether to:
Allow the request to proceed (NextResponse.next()).
Redirect the user to another route (NextResponse.redirect()).
Return a custom response (NextResponse.json() or NextResponse.rewrite()).
