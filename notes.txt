Clipping Behavior:
When you apply borderRadius to a component,
the content inside the component is clipped according
 to the rounded corners.
 However, if the content exceeds the boundaries
  (like child elements or text that overflows),
 it may still appear outside the rounded corners.

The overflow: 'hidden' style is used to ensure that
 any content that goes beyond the component's
  boundary is clipped (hidden) and not rendered
   outside the rounded corners.

The asChild prop tells the Link to render its
child as
the clickable element, inheriting the functionality
 (like navigation)
without altering its structure or styling.
